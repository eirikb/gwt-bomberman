Bomberman
-

GWT version of bomberman, uses GWTEventService for game connection.


Run like this:

    sh install-file.sh
    mvn install gwt:run


*install-file.sh* will install some dependencies in your maven repo, workaround until later.  

simple-version is another version that is suppose to be client side only.
